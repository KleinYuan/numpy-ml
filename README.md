# Intro

We implement all machine learning algorithms, concepts and ideas here, with following principles:

- [X] Only use [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

- [X] All in modules/blocks

- [X] No dirty/garbage codes

- [X] As more matrix calculation as possible

- [X] As less for loops as possible

- [X] Write tests

- [X] Self-explained naming convention



# Machine Learning

Technically, we can create a mathematical model for any problems in the world with following elements:

- [X] Problem Definition

- [X] Historical Data

- [X] Model (Hypothesis)

- [X] Error (Loss, cost function, object function)

- [X] Optimizer
